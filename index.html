  <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a sixth year graduate student in mathematics at Cornell University. My advisor is
    <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mike/">Michael Stillman</a> and my research area is
    computational algebra. I grew up in Weaverville, North Carolina and spent my undergraduate
    years in Northfield, Minnesota at Carleton College, where I majored in mathematics, minored in
    Russian language, and took many courses in physics. In the past I have been a vegetable
    gardener, ballroom dancer, temporary Muscovite, ultimate frisbee player, mountain biker,
    clarinetist/saxophonist, math contest participant, and many others. Outside of math, I
    currently occupy myself with programming and running.

  <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
  <p>
    My primary research interests are in computational algebra, particularly efficient algorithms
    to compute Gr&ouml;bner bases. In the past I have studied the arc algebra, a generalization of
    the Kauffman bracket skein algebra, under the direction of
    <a href="https://www.cmc.edu/academic/faculty/profile/helen-wong">Helen Wong</a>. I also
    studied Hadamard difference sets while at the

  <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
  <h3>Enumerating Difference Sets</h3>
  <p>
    The DifSets package is a GAP package implementing an algorithm for enumerating all difference
    sets up to equivalence in a group. The package is not distributed with a standard install of
    GAP, but the latest <a href="projects/difsets-2.3.0.tar.gz">release (2.2.0)</a> is free to
    download here, and additional progress and updates can be found on
    <a href="https://github.com/dylanpeifer/difsets">GitHub</a>. Installing the package allows one
    to perform exhuastive searches or get access to the results of the successful searches of 1006
    of the 1032 groups of order less than 100 performed by the package.
  </p>
  <h3>The Gr&ouml;bner Walk</h3>
  <p>
    The GroebnerWalk package is a Macaulay2 package implementing the Gr&ouml;bner walk algorithm
    for computing Gr&ouml;bner bases. The package is distributed with a standard install of
    Macaulay2 1.11 and later. The latest
    <a href="projects/GroebnerWalk-1.0.0.tar.gz">release (1.0.0)</a> is also free to download here,
    and additional progress and updates can be found on
    <a href="https://github.com/dylanpeifer/GroebnerWalk">GitHub</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>Puzzles</h3>
  <p>
    I initially became interested in mathematics through math competitions, and I continue to enjoy
    solving puzzles related to math or programming. Puzzles I've recently been working on include
    those from
    <a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler</a>,
    <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/">Jane Street</a>,
    <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/">FiveThirtyEight</a>, and
