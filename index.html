    <h2 id="About Me">About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I am a fourth year graduate student in mathematics at Cornell University.
    My advisor is <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mike/">Michael Stillman</a> and my research area is computational algebra.
    I grew up in Weaverville, North Carolina and spent my undergraduate years in Northfield, Minnesota at Carleton College, where I majored in mathematics, minored in Russian language, and took many courses in physics.
    In the past I have been a vegetable gardener, ballroom dancer, temporary Muscovite, ultimate frisbee player, mountain biker, clarinetist/saxophonist, math contest participant, and many others.
    Outside of math, I currently occupy myself with playing flute, attempting to speak Spanish, and swimming.

    <h2 id="Research">Research</h2>
    <p>
    My primary research interests are in computational algebra, particularly efficient algorithms to compute Gr&ouml;bner bases.
    In the past I have studied the arc algebra, a generalization of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra, under the direction of <a href="http://people.carleton.edu/~hwong/About_Me.html">Helen Wong</a>.
    I also studied Hadamard difference sets while at the <a href="http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/math-reu/index.html">2013 San Diego State University Mathematics REU</a>.

    <h3>Difference Sets</h3>
    <p>
    During the 2013 San Diego State University REU I developed an algorithm to exhaustively enumerate difference sets in an arbitrary group.
    In 2016 I revisited this problem, improved and generalized my algorithm, and organized the result into a package for GAP.
    The latest full <a href="projects/difsets-2.0.0.tar.gz">release</a> and <a href="projects/results.zip">results</a> are free to download here, and additional progress and updates can be found on <a href="https://github.com/dylanpeifer/difsets">GitHub</a>.
    <h3>Puzzles</h3>
    <p>
    I initially became interested in mathematics through math competitions, and I continue to enjoy solving puzzles related to math or programming.
    Puzzles I've recently been working on include those from <a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler</a>, <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/">Jane Street</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/">FiveThirtyEight</a>, and <a href="https://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis/index.shtml">IBM Research</a>.
