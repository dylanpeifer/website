    <h2 id="About Me">About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I am a fourth year graduate student in mathematics at Cornell University.
    My advisor is <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mike/">Michael Stillman</a> and my research area is computational algebra.
    I grew up in Weaverville, North Carolina and spent my undergraduate years in Northfield, Minnesota at Carleton College, where I majored in mathematics, minored in Russian language, and took many courses in physics.
    In the past I have been a vegetable gardener, ballroom dancer, temporary Muscovite, ultimate frisbee player, mountain biker, clarinetist/saxophonist, math contest participant, and many others.
    Outside of math, I currently occupy myself with playing flute, attempting to speak Spanish, and weightlifting.

    <h2 id="Research">Research</h2>
    <p>
    My primary research interests are in computational algebra, particularly efficient algorithms to compute Gr&ouml;bner bases.
    In the past I have studied the arc algebra, a generalization of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra, under the direction of <a href="http://people.carleton.edu/~hwong/About_Me.html">Helen Wong</a>.
    I also studied Hadamard difference sets while at the <a href="http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/math-reu/index.html">2013 San Diego State University Mathematics REU</a>.

    <h3>Enumerating Difference Sets</h3>
    <p>
    The DifSets package is a GAP package implementing an algorithm for enumerating all difference sets up to equivalence in a group.
    The package is not distributed with a standard install of GAP, but the latest <a href="projects/difsets-2.1.0.tar.gz">release (2.1.0)</a> is free to download here, and additional progress and updates can be found on <a href="https://github.com/dylanpeifer/difsets">GitHub</a>.
    Installing the package allows one to perform exhuastive searches or get access to the results of the successful searches of 1004 of the 1032 groups of order less than 100 performed by the package.
    </p>
    <h3>The Gr&ouml;bner Walk</h3>
    <p>
    The GroebnerWalk package is a Macaulay2 package implementing the Gr&ouml;bner walk algorithm for computing Gr&ouml;bner bases.
    The package is distributed with a standard install of Macaulay2 1.11 and later.
    The latest <a href="projects/GroebnerWalk-1.0.0.tar.gz">release (1.0.0)</a> is also free to download here, and additional progress and updates can be found on <a href="https://github.com/dylanpeifer/GroebnerWalk">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Puzzles</h3>
    <p>
    I initially became interested in mathematics through math competitions, and I continue to enjoy solving puzzles related to math or programming.
    Puzzles I've recently been working on include those from <a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler</a>, <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/">Jane Street</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/">FiveThirtyEight</a>, and <a href="https://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis/index.shtml">IBM Research</a>.
